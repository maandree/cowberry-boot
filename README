Cowberry-boot is a rc script set for sysvinit
that is designed to be minimal and for booting
a GNU/Linux system on the Raspberry Pi.

Cowberry-boot does not support daemons, instead
you should manually configure it to start
daemons in the way supported by your GNU/Linux
distribution. Specifically you should start
network and ntpd so that the clock is set
correctly.
