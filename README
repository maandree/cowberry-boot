Cowberry-boot is a rc script set for sysvinit
that is designed to be minimal and for booting
a GNU/Linux system on the Raspberry Pi.

Cowberry-boot does not support daemons, instead
you should manually configure it to start
daemons in the way supported by your GNU/Linux
distribution. Specifically you should start
network and ntpd so that the clock is set
correctly.

Cowberry-boot is a based on, but is not a fork
of, pony-initialisation, which is a fork of
initscripts-fork which in turn is a fork of
Arch Linux's initscripts. However read_locale.sh
and inittab is mostly just straight up copies
of those in pony-initialisation. It is not a
fork becuase the code is not copied, it is
rewritten from scratch with knowledge of how it
is done was already done.
